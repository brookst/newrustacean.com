//! # Notes
//! This is a mostly-empty module, and it is intended as such. Why? Well,
//! because *almost* all the sample code exists in these comments, which serve
//! as the show notes. If you listen to the episode or take a look at the
//! [source files][src], you'll see how it works!
//!
//! [src]: /src/show_notes/src/e001.rs.html
//!
//! The components below are included *solely* so you can see how the
//! docstrings work with each kind of thing. Make sure to click on the names of
//! the items: there is more documentation there. Again, take a look at the
//! [source][src] to see how it looks in the context of a file module.
//!
//! Note that this module-level docstring uses `//!` rather than `///`-style
//! comments. This is because this docstring is documenting the item which
//! contains it, rather than the following item. Per [Rust RFC 505][1], the
//! preferred approach is always to use the "following" form (`///`) rather than
//! the "containing" form (`//!`), except for module-level docs like these.
//! (I will be following RFC 505 throughout.)

/// This is a sample structure, to demonstrate `rustdoc`/`cargo doc`.
///
/// All of this will be attached to the structure definition when you see it
/// live on the site. If you need to document members, you can do it inline!
///
/// It's worth taking a look at the [source] for this: you can see how private
/// and public fields are handled differently in the documentation.
///
/// [source]: /src/show_notes/src/e001.rs.html

/// You can also document the implementation. This is usually *not* going to be
/// something you particularly need with a `struct`, because you can just
/// attach the documentation to the `struct` itself. However, it *is* the kind
/// of thing that could be useful if you are implementing a `trait`. (More on
/// that in a later episode!)
